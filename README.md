# assisky
A Discord Speech-to-Text module made with Vosk. Yes, it works!

## **IMPORTANT!**
In Discord settings, if you are not in the Push-to-Talk mode in "Voice & Video" and you are in the Voice Activity mode, you must disable "Automatically determine input sensivity" option and set it to lowest value. Like in this screenshot:
